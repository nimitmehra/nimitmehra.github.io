This results in nearly all our decisions - from choosing our course of study, to dating, to food choices and many more. At each point of our life, we end up asking what if this does it work out? And by and large, in our early twenties this is a good way to think about our decisions.</p><p>However, starting late twenties and definitely in our 30s it is a pretty bad way to think about our life. While optionality is great to be a generalist, the true value and rewards come with specialization. The only way to hone your craft is to spend an inordinate amount of time working on your skill. This comes at the expense of saying no to other things that one may pursue. A top specialist is valued more than an average specialist.</p><p>I am now on the wrong side of my thirties. I have many friends who are still in the dating market or who have not planned a family. For some it is a conscious decision they have taken carefully studying the pros and cons and are clear about what they want. But many others are still increasing optionality. They do not want to get settled with a partner thinking what if I find somebody better. They do not want to start a family thinking about what if they find a better career opportunity and have to move. The what if is not defined but they do not want to reduce the optionality.</p><p>When we are young, we are rarely confronted with our mortality. Life is one long highway. However, as we grow old, we realize that our time is limited. At some point, we would leave. There would be a full stop someday and constantly increasing opportunities would only mean we never took our shot. As a cricket analogy, it would mean that we saved our wicket to accelerate later but the overs finished before could accelerate.</p><p>Hence, I believe in our thirties we should start reducing optionalities and start committing - to a career, a partner, a lifestyle, a city and start making decisions. In the second half of our life we should start taking shots at the goal. All of us want to leave a legacy. Something the world would remember us by. Others want to make an impact while on earth. In both these cases, we need to start making decisions - reducing optionality.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/35/5118aeac-2caa-4ec6-b9c3-2f2e58b8316e_1024x1024.webp" alt="A man walking on a path through with many paths divurge" width="1024" height="1024" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/35/responsive/5118aeac-2caa-4ec6-b9c3-2f2e58b8316e_1024x1024-xs.webp 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/35/responsive/5118aeac-2caa-4ec6-b9c3-2f2e58b8316e_1024x1024-sm.webp 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/35/responsive/5118aeac-2caa-4ec6-b9c3-2f2e58b8316e_1024x1024-md.webp 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/35/responsive/5118aeac-2caa-4ec6-b9c3-2f2e58b8316e_1024x1024-lg.webp 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/35/responsive/5118aeac-2caa-4ec6-b9c3-2f2e58b8316e_1024x1024-xl.webp 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/35/responsive/5118aeac-2caa-4ec6-b9c3-2f2e58b8316e_1024x1024-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-making-others-happy/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> On making others happy</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-being-couragious/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> On Being Couragious</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
