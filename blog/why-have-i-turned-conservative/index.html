I was brought up in a religious but liberal family. That sounds like an oxymoron, but it is true. We used to visit the temple and do pooja every day, but my best friend when I was a kid was a Muslim, and I never remember my parents ever objecting to it. My family used to vote for the BJP, but it was mostly in opposition to Congress and its alleged corruption.</p><p>As I went to college, I remember my beliefs changing. My thought process was a lot more liberal. I looked at right-wing parties as extremists who trample on peopleâ€™s rights. I believed that for the progress of the country we needed to be socially liberal but economically capitalist. I remember my parents voting for Congress in the 2009 election, the first time for them in their life.</p><p>Lately, however, I am again leaning conservative in my outlook. A couple of events have shaped this change. I have seen the rise of anti hindu tirade amongst other religious groups - some bordering on separatism. This is by Khalistani supporters in Punjab and Canada and by separatists movements in north east of the country. The fact that it is a body of converts who are now disavowing their cultural heritage brings back my generational trauma which my grand parents used to speak of when they mentioned the patition.</p><p>There has been an increase in conversion happening across the country mostly in economically disadvantaged groups. A demographic change led by illegal immigrants coming in the country. In a democratic setup - this can easily lead to a situation where within a generation or two ( which can be 30 years) - the cultural fabric of the country changes and another partition is demanded by the people.</p><p>Liberalism is a luxury when one is in the majority and a necessity when one is in the minority. However, the true test of character comes when the previous religious minority becomes majority and how it treats the new minorities. As we have seen in Pakistan - no minority survives. If one cries of minority rights when in minority and makes sure that there are no minorities left when in majority, then I would rather be a conservative and save myself.</p><p>Being father of girls is also a reason why I am worried. My fear is my daughters leaving away the cultural heritage of 5000 years which has survived multiple invasions and attacks on our way of life. It comes down to my upbringing and my sanskar. I donot want them to be bigots but I also donot want them to be fools. I want to them to study and understand the history of their way of life and their religion so they can defend their thoughts when they are being brainwashed.</p><p>Hence I shall vote BJP even if it means supporting corruption and bad roads. I shall do it to preserve my way of life and not have the same fate as my grandparents.</p><p>Because what is home - a place where you feel safe to practice your way of life.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
