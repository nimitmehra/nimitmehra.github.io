People are calling it Hindi imposition, while others are worried that their children would have to learn a new language.</p><p>I have a different take and welcome the fact that children are encouraged to study local languages. Here are my reasons.</p><ol><li><p>Indian states - specially the coastal one’s are reaching per capita GDPs of $4.5K. Putting them in the upper middle income bracket. Their GDP and buying capacity would make them attractive markets to localise offerings. Language would be the key in this case.</p></li><li><p>All higher level and technical concepts in India are taught in English. Shortage of quality English teachers means that even when these concepts are taught, it is not understood well. A course imparted in local language maintaining the quality in English would lead to wider reach and deeper understanding - even for well healed kids.</p></li><li><p>The best way to understand the culture of any place is by embracing the language. Would Mumbai be any fun without embracing the culture of Ganpati visarjan, and would one know the beautiful aarti without understanding Marathi?</p></li></ol><p>However, there are a few things that need to be taken care of</p><ol><li><p>States need to ensure that there are institutes and courses which provide workable language training in a fun and easy way. Most courses are designed so that students can pursue higher studies. But I just want to be able to speak, understand and read Kannada to get by in Bangalore. An Alliance Française of Indian languages is needed.</p></li><li><p>Pedagogy, Training and imparting of education standards in local languages needs to be at par with that of English. Create a generation of highly skilled technicians who know their craft. A Chinese worker learned his craft in Cantonese, that he knows English enhances his market rate. Same is needed here.</p></li></ol></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on October 5, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-confidence/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> On Confidence</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/india-and-need-of-an-information-czar/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> India and Need of an Information Czar</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" class="feed__author">Nimit Mehra</a> <time datetime="2024-09-24T19:59" class="feed__date">September 24, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/about-us-tv-market/">About US TV Market</a></h3></header><p>I have been in the Bay area for last few days.
