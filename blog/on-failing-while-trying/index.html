I had done pretty well in the tenth standard, exceeding even my own expectations. So when I came in eleventh, I expected myself to do similarly well. I was completely wrong. </p><p>The thing was that by the end of the tenth standard, I had practised the questions so many times that I knew the answer many times before even reading the full question. Obviously, when the grade changed, I had to start from zero, learn new concepts, make mistakes, learn from them, absorb the concepts and then master them. But my ego and the image of invincibility and false genius I had made up in my mind did not let me make mistakes. It did not let me introspect and hence did not let me grow. I did rectify it a bit next year, but the lesson remained. </p><p>I have seen this pattern repeat more times than I can count. Whenever a successful person is given a new domain, there is a high probability that he/she will fail. The failure has more to do with the ego than with anything else. The previous success has built an aura of invincibility around them. The internal dialogue is that they are better than the next person. They are unwilling to learn, exposing their vulnerability and making mistakes. More often than not they go back to what they were doing. </p><p>But real growth happens by making mistakes and learning from them. One should be willing to fail miserably in practice and get better, rather than fail on the stage itself. It is a lesson which I took to the heart. While I tend to forget it from time to time ( expertise is its own coccoon) I remember the time I was 16 and get back to being open to make mistakes and learn from them. </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/77/indianeagle_a_cartoon_in_pixar_style_of_a_child_falling_of_a__b5ce68d0-238b-48d8-bd04-1f8c43ede52a_3.png" alt="A boy falling from the bike while riding" width="1024" height="1024" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/77/responsive/indianeagle_a_cartoon_in_pixar_style_of_a_child_falling_of_a__b5ce68d0-238b-48d8-bd04-1f8c43ede52a_3-xs.png 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/77/responsive/indianeagle_a_cartoon_in_pixar_style_of_a_child_falling_of_a__b5ce68d0-238b-48d8-bd04-1f8c43ede52a_3-sm.png 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/77/responsive/indianeagle_a_cartoon_in_pixar_style_of_a_child_falling_of_a__b5ce68d0-238b-48d8-bd04-1f8c43ede52a_3-md.png 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/77/responsive/indianeagle_a_cartoon_in_pixar_style_of_a_child_falling_of_a__b5ce68d0-238b-48d8-bd04-1f8c43ede52a_3-lg.png 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/77/responsive/indianeagle_a_cartoon_in_pixar_style_of_a_child_falling_of_a__b5ce68d0-238b-48d8-bd04-1f8c43ede52a_3-xl.png 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/77/responsive/indianeagle_a_cartoon_in_pixar_style_of_a_child_falling_of_a__b5ce68d0-238b-48d8-bd04-1f8c43ede52a_3-2xl.png 1920w"></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on October 16, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-repetition/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> On Repetition</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/about-credentials/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> About Credentials</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
