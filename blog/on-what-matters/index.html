What I clearly remember about it is that when I was going through it, suddenly, the priorities in my life were very clear. In those few seconds, it was clear to me what mattered to me. The thoughts were not about work, targets, money, or other things. They were about my family.</p><p>Thankfully, the experience remained near death, and I was completely safe; however, the feeling stayed with me for a long time.</p><p>We spend our time on this earth trying to remain busy. We will fill up this time by building tasks for us to achieve. This starts from school, getting into a good graduate school, taking the coveted job, and then chasing the promotion ladder, chasing money, wealth, and fame. But do these things matter?</p><p>Money is important. It gives you comfort and security in life. It gives you respect and self-confidence. But after a point it is just a number. The bigger one feels better, but it only leads to hubris and spending on signalling.</p><p>What truly matters is the love of the people you call your own and a healthy body. Money, fame and promotions cannot buy this. It requires effort from one’s side. Love cannot be transactional. You cannot expect something back. You need to provide love, care and comfort, hoping that the other person understands your feelings.</p><p>So now, whenever I am despondent or have to make a decision, I think about whether this thing truly matters to me or how it would affect the things that matter to me. Where would this thing rank if I learned that the world is ending tomorrow? It helps clear a lot of doubts, removes FOMO, and provides perspective.</p><p>So, what does truly matter to you?</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/37/53d785ab-eec0-4a4d-a260-fbb6b9355e82_1456x816.webp" alt="A pair of hands looking at a dated family photograph" width="1456" height="816" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/37/responsive/53d785ab-eec0-4a4d-a260-fbb6b9355e82_1456x816-xs.webp 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/37/responsive/53d785ab-eec0-4a4d-a260-fbb6b9355e82_1456x816-sm.webp 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/37/responsive/53d785ab-eec0-4a4d-a260-fbb6b9355e82_1456x816-md.webp 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/37/responsive/53d785ab-eec0-4a4d-a260-fbb6b9355e82_1456x816-lg.webp 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/37/responsive/53d785ab-eec0-4a4d-a260-fbb6b9355e82_1456x816-xl.webp 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/37/responsive/53d785ab-eec0-4a4d-a260-fbb6b9355e82_1456x816-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-networking/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> On Networking</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-complementing-people/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> On Complementing People</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" class="feed__author">Nimit Mehra</a> <time datetime="2024-03-31T15:50" class="feed__date">March 31, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/what-keeps-the-fire-burning/">What Keeps The Fire Burning?</a></h3></header><p>Today during my morning run I saw a kid no more than 10 carrying a large cricket kit bag, wearing the India cap, waiting for his cab.
