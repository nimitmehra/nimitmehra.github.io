In my life, especially my career, there have been many situations where I feel I have stayed too long. Be it quitting a role I am not enjoying, quitting a company when my intended objective ( and those of the company is achieved), or staying with a project too long hoping to turn it around. It never really works. Most of the time, one always leaves as the guy closing out the lights.</p><p>So why do I stay too long? It is a combination of factors. Sometimes it is related to the prestige of the brand or job. “<em>I worked so hard to get it, people perceive it as a great brand, I would be a fool to leave it</em>”. Other times it is about - “<em>what would the people around me think, that I am leaving them alone”</em>. There is also the element of trying to meet others’ expectations - either returns to the people who believed in you, invested in you, or gave their time for you.</p><p>However, I don’t think anybody cares. We delude ourselves into thinking that we are the center of the universe and our actions are constantly watched. People do not think about you. Everybody thinks about their own position, own life, and own path. Sometimes our paths meet and we journey together. However, it is the nature of paths that they diverge. If you do not take yours, the only one reaching the destination late would be you.</p><p>And hence, it is always better to be ruthless and to dispassionately evaluate the situation. At every point we should ask the following -</p><ol><li><p>What is the value I am adding by staying in?</p></li><li><p>What is the value that is being added to me?</p></li><li><p>How passionate I am about this situation?</p></li><li><p>What are my goals and how does staying in or out achieve them?</p></li></ol><p>There would be short-term pain. Even some bridges burnt, but it would be better - for you, for the situation and for others. Always be rational, evaluate other points and act fast! It is never good to stay too long.</p><p>Always be ruthless!</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/8/8d7ff351-df88-4011-a7f5-203e98efb6d0_1024x1024.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/8/responsive/8d7ff351-df88-4011-a7f5-203e98efb6d0_1024x1024-xs.webp 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/8/responsive/8d7ff351-df88-4011-a7f5-203e98efb6d0_1024x1024-sm.webp 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/8/responsive/8d7ff351-df88-4011-a7f5-203e98efb6d0_1024x1024-md.webp 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/8/responsive/8d7ff351-df88-4011-a7f5-203e98efb6d0_1024x1024-lg.webp 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/8/responsive/8d7ff351-df88-4011-a7f5-203e98efb6d0_1024x1024-xl.webp 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/8/responsive/8d7ff351-df88-4011-a7f5-203e98efb6d0_1024x1024-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/win-the-crowd/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Win the crowd!</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/the-perils-of-being-an-ostrich/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The Perils of Being an Ostrich</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
