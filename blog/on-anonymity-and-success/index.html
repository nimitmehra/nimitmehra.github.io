The walls were plastered with ads for IELTS, selling the dream of immigrating to Canada, the UK, or Australia. It appeared that that was the only industry flourishing in the state. Selling the dream of untold riches that await beyond the shores.</p><p>During my travels to the above countries, I have seen Indians be moderately successful, hardworking, and better assimilated than the other ethnicities. They are often in professions or vocations they might not pursue in India.</p><p>I believe anonymity plays a big role in their success. Being away from home, societal pressures, and expectations, they can make decisions that make monetary sense but may be frowned upon socially. They craft their own identity without having to think about what others would think. They become successful, dominate that line of business, and form their own community. In 10 - 15 years, their success and money makes the vocation respectable, and the next generation aspires to take it up when it immigrates. Money can buy respect ( even if grudging).</p><p>We spend countless hours thinking about what others think. We are afraid of judgment. Everybody judges till you are successful. Then you are respected. Anonymity gives you a platform to work without being judged. You can craft your new identity and be who you want. A sort of a shield to protect you till you are successful. This is why a new location and a new job at times bring you success. It saves you from the mental load of perception.</p><p>But why do you have to wait to be anonymous? What would you do today if you were freed from the pressures of the judgment of others? How would you change if you were anonymous?</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/19/5f4029f0-ba4e-4b1b-8937-fad8658eb8fe_1024x1024.webp" alt="Punjabi Society" width="1024" height="1024" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/19/responsive/5f4029f0-ba4e-4b1b-8937-fad8658eb8fe_1024x1024-xs.webp 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/19/responsive/5f4029f0-ba4e-4b1b-8937-fad8658eb8fe_1024x1024-sm.webp 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/19/responsive/5f4029f0-ba4e-4b1b-8937-fad8658eb8fe_1024x1024-md.webp 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/19/responsive/5f4029f0-ba4e-4b1b-8937-fad8658eb8fe_1024x1024-lg.webp 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/19/responsive/5f4029f0-ba4e-4b1b-8937-fad8658eb8fe_1024x1024-xl.webp 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/19/responsive/5f4029f0-ba4e-4b1b-8937-fad8658eb8fe_1024x1024-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/the-stories-we-tell-ourselves/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Stories we Tell Ourselves</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/about-self-respect/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> About Self Respect</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" class="feed__author">Nimit Mehra</a> <time datetime="2024-07-07T16:29" class="feed__date">July 7, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/nothing-succeeds-like-success-2/">Nothing Succeeds Like Success</a></h3></header><p>The recent India win in the T20 World Cup is a story of the individual redemption of many players, none more so than that of Hardik Pandya.
