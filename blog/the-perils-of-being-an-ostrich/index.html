It is the largest bird but is flightless. It is the fastest bi pedal runner in the world but it usually uses it to run away from danger. Unlike Emu’s which are similar ( and the only animal to win a war against humans), Ostriches prefer not to confront danger. When they sense danger, they take their neck close to the ground hoping to be invisible ( great try for a 9 feet tall animal)</p><p>The danger never passes. It is a fool’s errand to think that if we close our eyes and do not think about danger, it will not affect us. The danger looks at the Ostrich, laughs and then proceeds to do exactly what’s in its nature. Wishing the problems away never works.</p><p>All through my life, there have been many instances when I have tried to behave like an Ostrich. When faced with a problem, I have tried to bury my head hoping the problem would go away by itself. As a kid, it even worked at times. An elder would take care of it. But as you start facing the world, you realize that there is nobody who is coming to help you. You are on your own. Your problems do not go away. So rather than bury your head, start facing them.</p><p>Start embracing problems, learn to live with pain, enjoy the struggle, be ok being uncomfortable. It would be difficult at first. You would think of yourself as a failure. It would burst the grandiose image of yourself, you have built in your head. You would face rejection, ridicule, even realise you do not matter. You would be confronted with your deficiencies. But if you start embracing the struggle, letting go of your ego and move ahead, at some point you would see attitudes changing. Then there will come a time when you would master and solve the problem. It is only then when you will grow.</p><p>So use the framework - Look at the problem, Look at your current state and the state when you sole the problem. Then ook for tools that would help you master the problem. Let go of your ego, know your current state and work hard, ask for help and aquire skills.</p><p>Be an Emu and not an Ostrich.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/9//7064bfdb-27f3-4372-b80d-1e541ba9e5c0_1024x1024.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/9//responsive/7064bfdb-27f3-4372-b80d-1e541ba9e5c0_1024x1024-xs.webp 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/9//responsive/7064bfdb-27f3-4372-b80d-1e541ba9e5c0_1024x1024-sm.webp 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/9//responsive/7064bfdb-27f3-4372-b80d-1e541ba9e5c0_1024x1024-md.webp 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/9//responsive/7064bfdb-27f3-4372-b80d-1e541ba9e5c0_1024x1024-lg.webp 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/9//responsive/7064bfdb-27f3-4372-b80d-1e541ba9e5c0_1024x1024-xl.webp 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/9//responsive/7064bfdb-27f3-4372-b80d-1e541ba9e5c0_1024x1024-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/ruthlessness/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Ruthlessness</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/about-luck/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> About Luck!</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" class="feed__author">Nimit Mehra</a> <time datetime="2025-09-15T12:55" class="feed__date">September 15, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/importance-of-being-rooted/">Importance of Being Rooted</a></h3></header><p>I recently finished reading Pandeymonium by Piyush Pandey.
