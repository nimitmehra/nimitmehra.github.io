That meant there were long periods when I only had myself for company. This was the pre-internet era, when TV was viewed as a distraction that kids should not have controlled. Hence I used to spend long periods of time alone with my thoughts. I used to day dream a lot, but I also became a keen observer and thinker. I could think deeply and postulate making connections which were not apparent on the surface. I had started to enjoy the solitude, it was my friend. I craved for it.</p><p>Now, I have become a slave to my mobile. There is a constant need to check YouTube or Twitter as if I would lose out on something if I did not have the information first. I want bite-sized information on dopamine hits. I do not consume long-form content, either or video or very rarely on a book. I hardly spend time with my thoughts away from my devices. Some way my hypothesis and knowledge has become superficial. I have a high breadth but little depth. To master anything one requires depth.</p><p>I need to get back to the idea of spending time with myself away from the phone and gadgets. Just me and my thoughts - no music, sound, or other activity. Let my thoughts build on themselves. it would be scary but I might discover an old companion and friend, the one who accompanied me when I was a kid.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/47/9458468b-0d44-415c-a96f-006630ab8113_1456x816.webp" alt="A child sitting in front of french windows" width="1456" height="816" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/47/responsive/9458468b-0d44-415c-a96f-006630ab8113_1456x816-xs.webp 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/47/responsive/9458468b-0d44-415c-a96f-006630ab8113_1456x816-sm.webp 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/47/responsive/9458468b-0d44-415c-a96f-006630ab8113_1456x816-md.webp 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/47/responsive/9458468b-0d44-415c-a96f-006630ab8113_1456x816-lg.webp 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/47/responsive/9458468b-0d44-415c-a96f-006630ab8113_1456x816-xl.webp 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/47/responsive/9458468b-0d44-415c-a96f-006630ab8113_1456x816-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/multitasking-is-for-schmucks/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Multitasking is for schmucks!</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-trust/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> On Trust</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" class="feed__author">Nimit Mehra</a> <time datetime="2025-05-14T12:38" class="feed__date">May 14, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/india-and-need-of-an-information-czar/">India and Need of an Information Czar</a></h3></header><p>The recent India-Pakistan clashes of 2025 resulted in a military victory for India, but it appeared that Pakistan won the narrative war. Indians felt shortchanged and cheated. More so because we were winning but nobody was acknowledging it.
