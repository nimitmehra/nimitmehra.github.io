We lionise the physical act of putting ourselves in harms way. However, I think courage is a lot more than that. Courage is about fighting and overcoming our internal demons. The voice in our head which keeps telling us the task is too difficult, what would others think and whether we are good enough.</p><p>A lot of battles are mental. They are fought in the head. Belief in our abilities and a cavalier attitude about not caring about what others think are the main ingredients for success.</p><p>I have often held back from doing something either because I think I am not good enough or the thing is too tough. This is a false internal dialogue because it accepts defeat even before the battle. I go through the motions of the battle, but to me, the result is foretold. However, when I see a peer complete the task or win the battle, my belief in my abilities changes. I perceive that the battle is there to be won. I work hard and often come up with trumps. To me, having a disdain for the position is often the case when I do well in the position. I always work hard but the only thing is that I believe I can achieve.</p><p>The second internal battle is when I stop doing something and think about what others might say. This is the spotlight effect. People do not care. They are too busy with their lives to even think about me. Nobody is looking at me. When one starts, one is always shit, people will laugh. But here is the thing: everybody respects success. If you are successful, the derision changes to envy, and then the grapes sour. One shouldn’t care about others. Do what you believe is right. Forget the world.</p><p>It requires courage to do all of the above. It requires courage to tell your internal dialogue to shut up and believe that the thing can be won. It also requires courage to start something you believe in without caring about what the world thinks. It helps us to be singular and overcome our mental demons.</p><p>Have the courage to conquer your mind!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tlgQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener" class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tlgQ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tlgQ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tlgQ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tlgQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/36/9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024.webp" alt="A warrior standing on a scorched earth" width="1024" height="1024" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/36/responsive/9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024-xs.webp 640w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/36/responsive/9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024-sm.webp 768w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/36/responsive/9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024-md.webp 1024w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/36/responsive/9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024-lg.webp 1366w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/36/responsive/9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024-xl.webp 1600w, https://nimitmehra.com/media/posts/36/responsive/9f96cb6a-b9d4-4900-a4d9-9d968a904514_1024x1024-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nimitmehra.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" rel="author">Nimit Mehra</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-reducing-optionality/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> On Reducing Optionality</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/on-networking/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> On Networking</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/by/nimit-mehra/" class="feed__author">Nimit Mehra</a> <time datetime="2025-09-15T12:55" class="feed__date">September 15, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://nimitmehra.com/blog/importance-of-being-rooted/">Importance of Being Rooted</a></h3></header><p>I recently finished reading Pandeymonium by Piyush Pandey.
